# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate the development of fraud detection algorithms and models to identify potentially fraudulent transactions with various ML models.
This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023. It comprises over 550,000 records, and the data has been anonymized to protect the cardholders' identities. The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate the development of fraud detection algorithms and models to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

**#Key Features:**
1.id: Unique identifier for each transaction
2.V1-V28: Anonymized features representing various transaction attributes (e.g., time, location, etc.)
3.Amount: The transaction amount
4.Class: Binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)

**Potential Use Cases:**
1.Credit Card Fraud Detection: Build machine learning models to detect and prevent credit card fraud by identifying suspicious transactions based on the provided features.
2.Merchant Category Analysis: Examine how different merchant categories are associated with fraud.
3.Transaction Type Analysis: Analyze whether certain types of transactions are more prone to fraud than others.

**Data Source: **
!.The dataset was collected from credit card transactions made by European cardholders in 2023, with sensitive information removed to ensure privacy and compliance with ethical guidelines.
